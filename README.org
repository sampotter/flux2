* flux

  The goal of this project is to slowly start to consolidate and
  finalize a variety of things I've been working on for PSI and NASA
  related to applying hierarchical matrix algorithms to thermal and
  illumination modeling.

  More details will appear here as I start to flesh this project
  out. Right now, the existing code is spread across a few other of my
  respositories (specifically, [[https://github.com/sampotter/flux][flux]] and [[https://github.com/sampotter/psi-radiosity-notebooks][psi-radiosity-notebooks)]]. The
  code in these other repositories is in a prototype state at the
  moment.

** Compilation

   This is a C++ project with tight Python bindings developed using
   [[https://pybind11.readthedocs.io][pybind11]]. To compile the Python module and install it, do something
   like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ pip install .
#+END_SRC
